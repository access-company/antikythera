# Templates for Dynamic HTML

**Note:** This page is being updated for OSS release. Please be patient.

- Gears can use [HAML templates](http://haml.info/) to render dynamic HTML.
- We are using [calliope](https://github.com/nurugger07/calliope) as the HAML engine.
  Please refer to calliope's documentation for its syntax.
- To use HAML:
    - Confirm that `web/template.ex` is present (it's automatically generated by the gear generator).
    - Place your HAML files under `web/template/`.
    - HAML templates are processed during `$ mix compile` and content of each file
      is packed into a clause of `YourGear.Template.content_for/2`.
    - Render HTML responses by using `render/5` function in your controller action.
- HTML-escaping in HAML templates
    - Dynamic parts in HAML templates are automatically HTML-escaped
      (i.e. special characters are replaced with character entity references).
    - If you want to insert elements without escaping, use `Antikythera.TemplateSanitizer.raw/1`.
      `Antikythera.TemplateSanitizer` is automatically `import`ed and thus you can just write
      e.g. `= raw "<this won't be escaped>"` in your HAML templates.
- Inserting other templates in a template (a.k.a. partial rendering)
    - You can simply call `content_for/2` (without `YourGear.Template.` prefix) from within your HAML templates.
      e.g. `= content_for "path/to/other/template", param1: value1`
