Sometimes antikythera gears want to show translated messages to users.
For this purpose antikythera comes with Elixir's [gettext](https://github.com/elixir-lang/gettext) package.
Documentation for gettext package is available [here](https://hexdocs.pm/gettext/Gettext.html).

[Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) itself is one of GNU projects, and used in many other languages.

## Preparing translations

- To use gettext you must define `YourGear.Gettext`.
    - Antikythera's gear generator script automatically sets up `YourGear.Gettext`.
- Translation files are located in `priv/gettext/${locale}/LC_MESSAGES/${domain}.po`.
    - `${locale}` is a locale such as `en`, `jp`, etc. Default locale is `en`.
    - `${domain}` is the domain that can be used with `dgettext` and defaults to `default`.

## Workflow using Gettext mix tasks and macros

- You can also use [`mix gettext.extract`](https://hexdocs.pm/gettext/Mix.Tasks.Gettext.Extract.html#content)
  and [`mix gettext.merge`](https://hexdocs.pm/gettext/Mix.Tasks.Gettext.Merge.html#content) to manage translation files.
- As written in Gettext's [README](https://github.com/elixir-lang/gettext#workflow), the basic workflow will be as follows:
    1. Put `gettext/1,2`, `dgettext/2,3` or other translation **macro** calls in your sources code.
    2. Run `$ mix gettext.extract`. All messages will be extracted into template files (`priv/gettext/*.pot`).
        - This is basically an Elixir-equivalent of GNU's [xgettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#xgettext-Invocation).
    3. Run `$ mix gettext.merge priv/gettext/ --locale <locale>`. Template files will be merged into translation files.
        - Similarly, this corresponds to GNU's [msginit](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#msginit-Invocation)
          or [msgmerge](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#msgmerge-Invocation).
        - If the task is run for the first time, translation files will be generated from the template files.
    4. Add translations in translation files.
- Notice that you need to put **macro** calls in your code to use these features.
    - In other words, messages appearing in translation **function** calls (e.g. `Gettext.gettext(YourGear.Gettext, "Some message")`),
      cannot be extracted by the `gettext.extract` task.
- And importantly, messages passed to macro calls must be **compile-time strings**.
    - You must use function calls to translate messages that dynamically change on runtime.
- Consider these trade-offs before deciding whether you use this extract-and-edit workflow, or just manually manage translation files.

## Setting locale for each web request

- First you have to determine where to receive locale information from your users.
  Popular options are:
    - URL path: `/some/site/ja/hello.html`
    - query parameter: `/some/site/hello.html?locale=ja`
- Auto-generated `YourGear.Gettext` module comes with `put_locale/1`,
  which is a convenient wrapper around `Gettext.put_locale/2`.
  Invoke `put_locale/1` within your controller action as follows (here in the case of query parameter):
  ```elixir
  YourGear.Gettext.put_locale(conn.request.query_params["locale"] || "ja")
  ```

  The specified locale is stored within the process's process dictionary and will be used in later `*gettext` calls.
