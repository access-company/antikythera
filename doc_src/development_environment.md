# Development Environment

## Install Compilers and Build Tools

- Before anything else, do note that **an antikythera instance and its gears run in the same ErlangVM cluster**.
  Therefore, obviously, all development AND deployment environments must have the same Erlang and Elixir versions!
- We strongly recommend [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage this synchronization.
- Antikythera itself doesn't impose any version restrictions other than the one specified in `mix.exs`.
  Individual antikythera instance project may enforce a more fine-grained restrictions on language versions.
- Other requirements:
    - Some dependencies contain C source code and thus a reasonably new C compiler is required.
    - In macOS you may be warned by outdated GNU make version during compiling antikythera's dependencies.
      In that case install GNU make using e.g. [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
      The installed executable is `gmake`; create a symlink named `make` in somewhere in your `$PATH`
      so that the desired version of make command is selected.
    - Install development header of [Expat](https://libexpat.github.io/), which is required by [fast_xml](https://github.com/processone/fast_xml) library.
        - In macOS this should be already installed. If not, install `expat` with homebrew.
    - On Linux you have to install `inotify-tools` to enable file system watching tools
      such as [exsync](https://github.com/falood/exsync) and [mix_test_watch](https://github.com/lpil/mix-test.watch).
- [Install asdf as explained in the official README.md](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf#setup)
- Install asdf plugins
    - `$ asdf plugin-add erlang`
    - `$ asdf plugin-add elixir`
    - `$ asdf plugin-add nodejs`
        - Node.js installation is optional. You do not need it if you are not using asset-related features.
- Install language versions
    - In order to invoke initial `mix deps.get`, you need to globally install reasonably new Erlang and Elixir versions.
        - `$ asdf install erlang x.y.z && asdf global erlang x.y.z`
        - `$ asdf install elixir x.y.z && asdf global elixir x.y.z`
    - Working on your antikythera instance:
        - If `.tool-versions` already exists, `$ asdf install`
        - If not,
            - `$ asdf local erlang x.y.z && asdf local elixir x.y.z`
            - then commit the generated `.tool-versions` file.
    - Working on a gear:
        - Make sure you have a valid symlink named `.tool-versions` which points to `deps/your_antikythera_instance/.tool-versions`
            - This way you can make your gear's language versions in sync with your antikythera instance.
            - If your gear is generated using [`mix antikythera.gear.new`](https://github.com/access-company/antikythera/blob/master/lib/mix/gear.new.ex),
              symlink to `.tool-versions` is automatically created.
        - `$ asdf install`


### Shell history in `iex`

- Although `iex` is able to remember commands executed in previous sessions, the feature is not enabled by default.
- It is highly recommended to set the following environment variable during development:
    - `export ERL_AFLAGS="-kernel shell_history enabled"` (for bash family)

## Prepare for Domain-based Routing

- Antikythera routes web requests by subdomains and paths. See [routing](https://hexdocs.pm/antikythera/routing.html).
- In local development, you must be able to resolve subdomain of localhost (e.g. `your-gear.localhost`) into loopback address (`127.0.0.1`).
    - The easiest way is to add a line like `127.0.0.1 your-gear.localhost` to your `/etc/hosts`.
    - Alternatively, you can setup a local DNS server (such as [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html)) to resolve all subdomains of localhost.

## Environment variables to tweak behavior of antikythera

- In your local environment you can customize some of antikythera's default settings using the following environment variables:
    - Runtime environment variables:
        - `BASE_DOMAIN`:
            - Suffix part of domain names to be used when clients interact with running gears. Defaults to `localhost`.
            - For example, when you are running `:some_gear` as `BASE_DOMAIN=somedomain iex -S mix`,
              you can browse the top page of the gear at `http://some-gear.somedomain:8080/` (assuming that the default port number is used; see below).
            - Note that when using `BASE_DOMAIN` other than `localhost`, you may need to tell the DNS resolver on the client side about the gear's domain name.
        - `PORT`:
            - Port number to receive incoming web requests from. Defaults to `8081` during `mix test`, and `8080` otherwise
              (thus one can run both `iex -S mix` and `mix test` at the same time).
            - Explicitly set this when you run multiple antikythera servers within your machine.
        - `TEST_PORT`:
            - Port number to send HTTP requests to during `blackbox_local` tests. Defaults to `8080`.
        - `NO_LISTEN`:
            - A boolean flag for disabling web server functionality of antikythera. Defaults to `false`.
            - `true` is implicitly set when using `Antikythera.Mix.Task.prepare_antikythera/0` in your mix task.
        - `LOG_LEVEL`:
            - Log level of all gears. Defaults to `info`. See also [logging](https://hexdocs.pm/antikythera/logging.html).
        - `SOME_GEAR_CONFIG_JSON`:
            - Gear config of `:some_gear`. See also [gear_config](https://hexdocs.pm/antikythera/gear_config.html).
    - Compile-time environment variables: (to change the followings you need to recompile antikythera)
        - `GEAR_ACTION_TIMEOUT`:
            - Milliseconds to wait until gear action finishes. Defaults to `10000`. See also [controller](https://hexdocs.pm/antikythera/controller.html).
        - `GEAR_PROCESS_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`:
            - Maximum size of per-process heap memory in words. Defaults to `50000000` (400MB in 64-bit architecture).
